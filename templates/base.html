        <p>
            Adaptive assessment is an evaluation technique that dynamically adjusts the difficulty of the test based on the learner's performance. This innovative approach ensures that each learner is presented with questions that match their current knowledge level, improving the accuracy of the evaluation and creating a personalized learning experience.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            By leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL), the system continuously learns and improves the selection of questions. As the learner progresses, RL helps optimize question difficulty and selects the most relevant content based on their past performance. The goal is to engage learners at the right level, ensuring an accurate assessment of their skills without overwhelming or under-challenging them.
        </p>

        <p>
            This adaptive assessment system not only provides a more personalized and efficient learning experience but also improves over time by adjusting its strategies. Whether in educational platforms or corporate training, RL-based adaptive assessments are revolutionizing how we evaluate and enhance learning outcomes.
